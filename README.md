# SwiftUIAPIWithTests

Here I have created Demo Application in SwiftUI, All implemented functionalities are listed below:
- Use MVVM Architecture.
- Proper folder structure.
- Make 2 API calls, one for Pokemon lists and one for their detail page.
- For API call, I have included 2 ways.
    1. Using Closures
    2. Using Async/Await
- Also Included Unit test cases for list API failure and success case.
- In Detail view, I have used AsyncImage which basically provided by SwiftUI after iOS 15. It can cache images automatically.
